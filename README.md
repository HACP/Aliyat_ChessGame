 In the image you can see the change in the colors based on how statistically probable is each move. This becomes a powerful to guide beginners while they learn the basic principles of the game
 
 ## Features
 * Converts portable game notation (PGN) into animations of a game
 * Highlight statistically common moves, helping the decision making
 * TODO: evaluate quality of opening following opening principles
